# Vendor Fork Governance

Skyforge pins vendor forks for `netlab` and `clabernetes`.

Governance rules:

- each pinned SHA must have a documented reason,
- branch/upstream tracking must be explicit,
- changes require compatibility validation before bumping SHA.

Canonical metadata is maintained in the meta repo under `vendor/VENDOR_POLICY.md`.
