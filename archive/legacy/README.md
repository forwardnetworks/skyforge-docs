# Legacy Archive

This directory contains historical migration plans, compatibility notes, and
evidence snapshots kept for traceability.

These files are **not authoritative runbooks** for the current Skyforge OSS
baseline. Prefer the top-level docs under `components/docs/` for active
deployment, operations, and architecture guidance.
